# Teacher User Guide

Welcome to **Peadological**, your personal AI-powered pedagogical coach. This guide will help you navigate your dashboard, understand your performance metrics, and use the platform to improve your teaching.

## 1. Getting Started

Upon logging in, you will be directed to your **Teacher Dashboard**. This is your central hub for all teaching insights.

### The Dashboard Interface

- **Profile Section**: Shows your name, department, and key aggregate stats:
  - **Avg. Score**: Your overall pedagogical effectiveness score.
  - **Lectures**: Total number of lectures analyzed.
  - **Streak**: Consecutive days of activity.
- **Notifications**: Click the bell icon in the top right to see alerts about completed analyses or system updates.

## 2. Understanding Your Metrics

Peadological analyzes your audio to provide five key pedagogical metrics. These are displayed as interactive cards on your dashboard.

| Metric                         | Goal                    | Description                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Review Ratio**               | High (>70%)             | Measures how effectively you review concepts from previous lectures in the first 5-8 minutes of class.                                     |
| **Question Velocity**          | Moderate (6-10 per 10m) | The frequency of questions you ask. Promotes interactivity and checks for understanding.                                                   |
| **Wait Time**                  | > 3 Seconds             | The silence you leave after asking a question. Longer wait times allow students to process and formulate better answers.                   |
| **Teacher Talking Time (TTT)** | Balanced (<70%)         | The percentage of time you are speaking versus students speaking or silence. Lower TTT often indicates more student-centered learning.     |
| **Hinglish Fluency**           | N/A                     | Accurately tracks your code-switching between Hindi and English (if applicable), ensuring the AI understands your natural speech patterns. |

## 3. Managing Your Timetable

Your schedule determines where your lectures are recorded and cataloged.

- **View Schedule**: The "My Timetable" tab shows your weekly class schedule.

  1.  Click the **"Add Class"** button.
  2.  Select the Day, Start Time, and End Time.

## 4. Analyzing a Lecture

To get feedback on a class, you need to submit a recording.

### Option A: Upload a Recording

1.  Navigate to the **"Upload"** tab (or click the upload icon).
2.  **Lecture Title**: Give your session a descriptive name (e.g., "Introduction to Algorithms").
3.  **Select Class**: Optionally link it to a specific slot in your timetable.
4.  **Audio File**: Select the MP3/WAV file of your lecture recording.
5.  Click **"Upload Recording"**.

_The system will process the audio (this may take a few minutes depending on length) and notify you when the analysis is ready._

## 5. Reviewing Results

Once analyzed, your lecture will appear in the **"Recent Lectures"** list. Click on any lecture to view:

- The specific scores for that session.
- Automated feedback and suggestions for improvement.
