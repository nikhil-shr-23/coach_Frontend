# Dean & Administrator Guide

The **Peadological Dean Dashboard** provides a bird's-eye view of your school or department's pedagogical performance. It enables you to identify trends, recognize top performers, and support faculty development without invasive micro-management.

## 1. Dashboard Overview

When you log in as a Dean, you see the **School Overview**:

### Key Cards

- **Total Faculty**: Number of active teachers in your purview.
- **Lectures Analyzed**: Total volume of classes processed by the system.
- **School Avg. Score**: The aggregate pedagogical score for all your faculty.
  - _Green (>80%)_: Excellent
  - _Amber (60-79%)_: Good/Average
  - _Red (<60%)_: Needs Attention
- **Pending Reviews**: Number of flagged or pending items requiring administrative look.

## 2. Departmental Performance

The dashboard breaks down performance by department (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering).

- **Use Case**: Quickly identify which departments are excelling and which might need more resources or training workshops.
- **Metrics**: View Faculty Count, Lectures Analyzed, and Average Score per department.

## 3. Faculty Directory

The bottom section of the dashboard is the **Faculty Directory**, a searchable list of all teachers.

### Features

- **Search**: Filter by name or department using the search bar.
- **Status Indicators**: See who is "Active" (recently uploaded lectures) vs. "Inactive".
- **Performance at a Glance**: View the `Avg. Score` for each teacher directly in the list.
- **Drill-Down**: Click the action menu (three dots) on a faculty row to view their detailed profile (coming soon).

## 4. Best Practices for Deans

- **Weekly Check-ins**: Review the "School Avg. Score" weekly to track improvements.
- **Celebrate Success**: Use the data to recognize departments or teachers with high "Student Engagement" (low Teacher Talking Time, high Question Velocity).
- **Targeted Support**: Identify teachers with consistently low "Wait Time" scores and suggest specific pedagogical techniques (e.g., "Think-Pair-Share") to help them improve.
